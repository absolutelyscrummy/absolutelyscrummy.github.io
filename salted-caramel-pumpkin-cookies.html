		Ingredients
		1 1/4 cup flour
		1/4 tsp baking soda
		1/4 tsp baking soda
		2 tsp salt
		1/2 cup browned butter(+1 icecube)
		1/2 cup toasted sugar
		1/4 cup brown sugar
		6 tbsp blotted pumpkin
		1 tsp vanilla

		Oven: 350 - convection

		First heat the butter in a pan on medium low heat unil brown bits form at the bottom, stiring constantly. Continue stiring off heat, adding an ice cube for moisture and to stop the butter from burning.

		Set aside in refrigerator to cool. (Note: I like to transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer)

		Combine flour baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

		Once the butter is opaque on the edges cream it together with the toasted sugar, until it's pale and creamy. Add brown sugar, pumpkin, and vanilla and combine until smooth.

		Add flour mixture and combine. 

		Let sit in fridge for a minimum of 1 hour, up to 24 hours.

		Bake at 350 for 8 minutes, or until edges start to brown.
